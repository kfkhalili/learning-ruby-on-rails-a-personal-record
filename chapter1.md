# Chapter 1 From zero to deploy

Valuable information from the first chapter.

"If you are new to the subject, the Ruby on Rails Tutorial will give you a thorough introduction to web application development, including a basic grounding in Ruby, Rails, HTML & CSS, databases, version control, testing, and deploymentâ€”sufficient to launch you on a career as a web developer or technology entrepreneur."

My Ruby is not terrible. My HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills are fledgling. I understand databases and my SQL is pretty good. I can use Git as well as any person so that's all good. I understand Test Driven Development, more or less. So this part of the book would be helpful.

"On the other hand, if you already know web development, this book will quickly teach you the essentials of the Rails framework, including MVC and REST, generators, migrations, routing, and embedded Ruby."

I know MVC well enough, but have never implemented it in code, and I know very little about REST, or the rest of the things he mentions.

"The Ruby on Rails Tutorial takes an integrated approach to web development by building three example applications of increasing sophistication, starting with a minimal hello app (Section 1.3), a slightly more capable toy app (Chapter 2), and a real sample app (Chapter 3 through Chapter 12)."

Nice so we'll do some work, the first app will be lame probably, the second one could be more interesting. The third will be more challenging for sure.

Reading a little deeper reveals that the third website will be a lot like twitter, that will be useful for my future projects. Mr Hartl assures us that we will learn generic principles, which are always the best to learn. He also says that your skills don't need to be high and that the book has proven to be pretty popular with complete beginners. He also promises to have made changes that aim to "lower the barrier to getting started with Rails"

First chapter task is to install necessary software and setup the git repository. We will conclude the task with deploying our first simple app to the web, I guess on Heroku. We will not be using much scaffolding in the beginning. He says it is a feature that generates code and might seem easier but can mess you up if you're a beginner trying to understand the basics.

The second chapter is about the second, more serious project. This chapter will explain the basic workings of a Rails application. We will use scaffolding here to generate code for the app.

The third chapter onto the end of the tutorial will be about building the twitter-like website and learning a whole lot. The second app will evolve into the third and final, sample app.


## Introduction

* In 2004, David Heinemeier Hansson wrote the Rails framework using the Ruby programming language. It has evolved into a powerful tool, used in several billion dollar companies. 
* Since then, the Ruby on Rails framework has grown to be so large that it pretty much has its own chunk of the web development industry.
* It is 100% open-source, available under the MIT License.
* Rails relies on awesome Ruby.
* Rails creates a domain-specific language for writing web applications. This means that generating data models and routing URLs is simpler with Rails. This leads to rapid web development.
*  Full use of REST architectural style for structuring web applications.
*  Rails creator always updates the project so you're always benefiting from new features in web development.
*  Rails has a very active community so googling errors helps a lot.
