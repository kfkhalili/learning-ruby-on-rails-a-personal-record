# Chapter 1 From zero to deploy

Valuable information from the first chapter.

"If you are new to the subject, the Ruby on Rails Tutorial will give you a thorough introduction to web application development, including a basic grounding in Ruby, Rails, HTML & CSS, databases, version control, testing, and deploymentâ€”sufficient to launch you on a career as a web developer or technology entrepreneur."

My Ruby is not terrible. My HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills are fledgling. I understand databases and my SQL is pretty good. I can use Git as well as any person so that's all good. I understand Test Driven Development, more or less. So this part of the book would be helpful.

"On the other hand, if you already know web development, this book will quickly teach you the essentials of the Rails framework, including MVC and REST, generators, migrations, routing, and embedded Ruby."

I know MVC well enough, but have never implemented it in code, and I know very little about REST, or the rest of the things he mentions.
