# Chapter 1 From zero to deploy

Valuable information from the first chapter.

"If you are new to the subject, the Ruby on Rails Tutorial will give you a thorough introduction to web application development, including a basic grounding in Ruby, Rails, HTML & CSS, databases, version control, testing, and deploymentâ€”sufficient to launch you on a career as a web developer or technology entrepreneur."

My Ruby is not terrible. My HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills are fledgling. I understand databases and my SQL is pretty good. I can use Git as well as any person so that's all good. I understand Test Driven Development, more or less. So this part of the book would be helpful.

"On the other hand, if you already know web development, this book will quickly teach you the essentials of the Rails framework, including MVC and REST, generators, migrations, routing, and embedded Ruby."

I know MVC well enough, but have never implemented it in code, and I know very little about REST, or the rest of the things he mentions.

"The Ruby on Rails Tutorial takes an integrated approach to web development by building three example applications of increasing sophistication, starting with a minimal hello app (Section 1.3), a slightly more capable toy app (Chapter 2), and a real sample app (Chapter 3 through Chapter 12)."

Nice so we'll do some work, the first app will be lame probably, the second one could be more interesting. The third will be more challenging for sure.

Reading a little deeper reveals that the third website will be a lot like twitter, that will be useful for my future projects. Mr Hartl assures us that we will learn generic principles, which are always the best to learn. He also says that your skills don't need to be high and that the book has proven to be pretty popular with complete beginners. He also promises to have made changes that aim to "lower the barrier to getting started with Rails"
