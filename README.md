# Our Guiding Tutorial

There are great ways to learn about Ruby on Rails, and there is a wealth of data available. One could find himself drowning in too much information, trying to go with different tutorials. I have fallen prey to that in my recent attempt to learn Ruby on Rails. To remedy this, I decided to keep this book of notes, and snippets of code that are useful to me while I follow a specific tutorial.

The tutorial I have chosen is [Ruby on Rails Tutorial (3rd Edition), Learn Web with Rails](https://www.railstutorial.org/book). As such, I've named my chapters after the chapters of the book, so it is easier for me to refer to them if needed. The book will also contain content from the tutorial that I have found valuable, and would like to refer back to.
